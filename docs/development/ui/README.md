# UI development

 - why GWT/GXT ?
 - there are many frameworks out there for web apps but this allowed client and server code to be in one* language and in same place

1. download and install java JDK
    - http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html
    - http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/8u102-b14/jdk-8u151-windows-x64.exe
    - OpenJDK should work also but was not tested

2. download and install eclipse
    - https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/technology/epp/downloads/release/2020-12/R/eclipse-jee-2020-12-R-win32-x86_64.zip
    - the zip seams to work better for me
    - Eclipse IDE for Java EE developers is closest to what we need

3. install the eclipse plugins
    1.  gwt plugin for eclipse
        - click on `help -> eclipse marketplace`
        - type gwt in search
        - install GWT eclipse plugin 3.0.0
        - ![plugin](gwt3-plugin.jpg?raw=true)
        - deselect gwt 2.7
        - ![selection](gwt3-selection.jpg?raw=true)
