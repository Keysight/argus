Contribution Guidelines
=======================

- If you want to contribute code enhancements you should create a new repository by creating a fork of the original and then create a pull request from a custom branch on your end (e.g. dev/myEnhancement).
- Create your pull request only against the **dev** branch.
- Make sure to provide a brief description that explains your contribution and why you are making the pull request.
- Create one pull request per enhancement/fix.
- Ensure that the changes you included in your pull request pass the existing unit tests.

Branch meaning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **main**: The main branch always contains the current official release.
- **dev**: The dev branch contains improvements and fixes of the current release that will go into the next release version. It is against this branch that you should be creating your pull requests.
